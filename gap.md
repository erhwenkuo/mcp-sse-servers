### Introduction
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that helps AI systems, like large language models (LLMs), connect with external data and tools. This response compares the MCP specification from November 5, 2024, to March 26, 2025, highlighting key differences to help you understand how it evolved.

### Key Differences
The 2025 version introduced several enhancements, focusing on security, flexibility, and usability. Here’s a breakdown:

- **Security Improvements**: A new authorization framework based on OAuth 2.1 was added, likely making it easier to control access to servers securely.
- **Data Transmission**: The way data is sent between systems changed from HTTP with Server-Sent Events (HTTP+SSE) to a more flexible Streamable HTTP, which may improve performance.
- **Enhanced Features**: Support for audio data was added, alongside new capabilities like JSON-RPC batching and tool annotations, which describe tool behaviors like being read-only or destructive.
- **User Experience**: Updates like a message field for progress notifications and argument autocompletion suggestions were included, potentially making interactions smoother.

These changes suggest MCP became more versatile and user-friendly, especially for developers building AI-powered applications.

### Unexpected Detail
One interesting addition is the support for audio data in the 2025 version, which wasn’t mentioned in the earlier specification. This could open up new use cases, like voice-based AI interactions, which might surprise users expecting only text and image support.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of MCP Specification Changes

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of the differences in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification between November 5, 2024, and March 26, 2025, based on available documentation. The comparison aims to elucidate the evolution of this open protocol, which facilitates seamless integration between large language model (LLM) applications and external data sources and tools, as developed by Anthropic.

#### Background and Context
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is designed to standardize how LLMs can access and utilize external context, such as files, databases, or services, to enhance their responses. The specification, hosted at [spec.modelcontextprotocol.io](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/), has seen updates, with versions dated November 5, 2024, and March 26, 2025, being of particular interest. Given the current date, March 29, 2025, these versions are recent and relevant for understanding the protocol’s development.

#### Methodology
The analysis involved reviewing the specification pages for both dates, focusing on key features, changes, and enhancements. The 2025-03-26 version includes a "Key Changes" section, which was pivotal in identifying differences, supplemented by examining the 2024-11-05 version for baseline features.

#### Detailed Comparison

##### Authorization Framework
- **Description**: This refers to the mechanism for controlling access to MCP servers, ensuring only authorized users or applications can interact with them.
- **2024-11-05 Status**: The specification included general guidelines for security and trust, emphasizing user consent for data access and operations. For instance, it stated that users must explicitly consent to and understand all data access and operations, and hosts must obtain explicit user consent before invoking any tool, as seen in the security section of [Model Context Protocol Specification 2024-11-05](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/). However, no specific authorization framework like OAuth 2.1 was mentioned.
- **2025-03-26 Status**: A comprehensive authorization framework based on OAuth 2.1 was added, as detailed in the changelog at [Key Changes – Model Context Protocol Specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/changelog/). This likely formalizes and standardizes the authorization process, enhancing security for server interactions.

##### Transport Layer
- **Description**: This is the method used for data transmission between clients and servers, critical for the protocol’s communication efficiency.
- **2024-11-05 Status**: The specification used JSON-RPC 2.0 for communication, but explicit mention of the transport layer was not found in the reviewed sections. However, the key changes for 2025 indicate a previous use of HTTP with Server-Sent Events (HTTP+SSE), inferred from the replacement in the later version.
- **2025-03-26 Status**: The transport layer was updated to Streamable HTTP, replacing HTTP+SSE, as noted in the changelog. This change, linked to PR [#206](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/pull/206), likely offers more flexibility or improved performance, though specific benefits weren’t detailed in the accessible content.

##### JSON-RPC Batching
- **Description**: This feature allows sending multiple JSON-RPC requests in a single message, potentially reducing network overhead and improving efficiency.
- **2024-11-05 Status**: Not supported, as per the absence in the specification and the addition in the 2025 changelog.
- **2025-03-26 Status**: Added support for JSON-RPC batching, as mentioned in the changelog, linked to [JSON-RPC specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#batch) and PR [#228](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/pull/228), enhancing the protocol’s capability for batch processing.

##### Tool Annotations
- **Description**: Descriptive labels or metadata for tools, indicating their behavior, such as whether they are read-only or can perform destructive operations, aiding in better control and understanding.
- **2024-11-05 Status**: Not mentioned in the reviewed features, suggesting this was not part of the specification at this stage.
- **2025-03-26 Status**: Added comprehensive tool annotations, as per the changelog, linked to PR [#185](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/pull/185), to describe tool behavior, enhancing usability and safety.

##### ProgressNotification
- **Description**: Notifications that inform about the progress of ongoing operations, crucial for user experience and debugging.
- **2024-11-05 Status**: Did not have a `message` field, as per the baseline features listed, focusing on basic progress tracking without detailed status updates.
- **2025-03-26 Status**: Added a `message` field to `ProgressNotification` for descriptive status updates, improving transparency and user interaction, as noted in the changelog.

##### Data Support
- **Description**: The types of data the protocol can handle and transmit, expanding its applicability.
- **2024-11-05 Status**: Supported text and image content types, as per the features listed in the specification, focusing on common data types for LLMs.
- **2025-03-26 Status**: Added support for audio data, joining text and image, as per the changelog, potentially opening up new use cases like voice-based AI interactions, an unexpected expansion given the prior focus.

##### Completions Capability
- **Description**: A feature allowing for providing suggestions or completions for arguments in requests, useful for user interfaces or assisting in constructing requests.
- **2024-11-05 Status**: Not explicitly mentioned, suggesting it was not a formalized capability at this stage.
- **2025-03-26 Status**: Added `completions` capability for argument autocompletion suggestions, as per the changelog, likely improving usability and efficiency for developers.
