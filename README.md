# Model Context Protocol (sse) servers

This repository is a collection of *reference implementations* for the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) with SSE, as well as references to community built servers and additional resources.

For many enterpises, it's no way to have each employees to connect to AI Tools without control and governance, it's critical to have these MCP tools with remote connect capabilities (sse) and allow enterprise to create a reliable and responsible environemnt to run AI realted usecases.

All the MCP servers listed in this repository showcase the versatility and extensibility of MCP, demonstrating how it can be used to give Large Language Models (LLMs) secure, controlled access to tools and data sources.

Each MCP server is implemented with either the [Typescript MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) or [Python MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk).

> Note: Lists in this README are maintained in alphabetical order to minimize merge conflicts when adding new items.
